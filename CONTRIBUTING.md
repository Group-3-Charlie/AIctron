## How to contribute ?

### Opening issues

- You can report bugs or suggest new features or enhancements.
- **Ensure the issue was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Group-3-Charlie/AIctron).
- And then, [open a new issue](https://github.com/Group-3-Charlie/AIctron/issues/new/choose).

### First Code Contribution

There are the steps to contribute as a developer :
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch :
  - For a feature : `git checkout -b dev/feature-name`
  - For a bug : `git checkout -b fix/issue-name`
  - For anything else : `git checkout -b other/name`
- Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
- Push to the branch (`git push origin branch-name`).
- Open a new Pull Request on your fork repository.

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
