## Description
Aictron is a web app that allows its users to get predictive data analysis by inserting any csv dataset. 
The app will use artificial intelligence, and more precisely machine learning with SKlearn Python library. 
The main advantage is a lightweight application, as machine-learning algorithms are resource-efficient, making it particularly useful for anyone needing to make predictions based on specific data. 
The app is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface. 
The user will be able to upload a dataset, select the target column and then get the prediction.


## Installation

### Backend
To install the app, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend
To start the frontend, you will need to have React installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official website](https://reactjs.org/).

Once React is installed, you can install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```


## Usage

To start the app, you will need to run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cd code
python3 __init__.py
```

Then, you will need to run the following command in another terminal:

```bash
npm run dev:web
```

If you want to run the desktop app, then run this command in another terminal:

```bash
npm run dev:electron
```
