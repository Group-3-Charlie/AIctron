- Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to investigate and address it.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability to access or modify data that does not belong to you.
- Do not engage in any activity that could harm the reliability, availability, or integrity of our systems.

## Additional Information
